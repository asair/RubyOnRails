Made my first steps in Ruby... Looks like I made it all wrong with newest version under Windows.
Starting installation from scratch:)

Dev Kit Installation guide:

Also decided to use Oracle 11g Express database which seems a good way to get into troubles.

Installed OCI8.
Tried to install activerecord-oracle-adapter... not working.
Changing configuration to use activerecord-oracle_enhanced-adapter
